{/* ## Global settings
Global settings are located on the "Options" page and apply to all hosts. They are:

- Port number (default: `25925`)
- Custom URL protocols

### Port number
Specify the WebSocket port that will be used to connect to the Pacy CLI. 
The default value is `25925`. 
After you set port number of the Pacy CLI using the `pacy set-port <port>` command, you should change it here manually.
If you don't know what port number the Pacy CLI is using, you can find it by running `pacy get-port` in the terminal.

### Custom URL protocols

You can use this section to add support for "Navigate to code" feature for editors other than VS Code, Windsurf, or Cursor. */}

## Per-host settings

Per-host settings apply to a specific host, identified by its domain name or IP address.
For example, if you have a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`, and adjust any per-host settings of Pacy on that host, those changes are remembered the next time you visit the same host.

Here are the settings that are per-host:

- AI agent (default: `Claude Code`)
- URL protocol (default: `vscode://`, inferred automatically when using agents other than **Claude Code**)
- Path prefix (Inferred automatically when using `@pacy-dev/devtools-plugin` and in some other cases)

<Aside>
If **Pacy** encounters a brand-new host, and if you have recently overriden AI agent or URL protocol settings for a previous host,
the new host will start off with the same values. For instance, if you selected `RooCode` instead of `Claude Code` on previous host in `http://localhost:3000`, if Pacy encounters a new host in `http://localhost:5173` for the first time, the AI agent will be set to `RooCode`.

{/* ### AI agent
This is the AI agent that receives your prompts. You can change this from the AI agents dropdown in the Chat tool. */}

### URL protocol

This setting determines the link that is opened when you click on "Navigate to code".
You don't need to manually set this when using Cline, RooCode, VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor.
You only need to set this when using **Claude Code** or **Codex**.
The default value is `vscode://`. 
In the three-dots menu under "URL protocol", you can instead choose `cursor://` or `windsurf://`, or a custom URL protocol you've created.

### Path prefix

This is the root directory of your project.
When you use `@pacy-dev/devtools-plugin` you don't need to set this manually as it will be inferred automatically from the nearest git root.

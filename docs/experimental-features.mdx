Currently, Pacy Devtools supports the following experimental features:

- **Console Tab**: Browse the console logs of your application. (Disabled by default)
- **Network Tab**: Browse network requests of your application. (Disabled by default)

These features are marked as experimental, because they require intercepting the `console`, `fetch`, and `XHR` APIs.
This is not a problem for most of the applications, but it might interfere with the error stack traces for some applications.

You can enable them from the Settings page. 
To go to the Settings page, click the three-dots icon in the top right corner of the Pacy Devtools island,
and select it from the dropdown menu. After toggling experimental features, you should refresh the browser for changes to take effect.

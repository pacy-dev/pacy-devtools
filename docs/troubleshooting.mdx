This guide covers common issues you might encounter while using Pacy and their solutions.

## Installation Issues

### IDE Extension Installation Issues

Installation from the command line might not work for some users.
Here, we provide 2 more alternative ways to install the extension.

#### Install from a link

You can install the extension to VSCode from the following link:

- <a href="vscode:extension/pacy-devtools.pacy-devtools-bridge">Install VSCode Extension</a>
- <a href="cursor:extension/pacy-devtools.pacy-devtools-bridge">Install Cursor Extension</a>
- <a href="windsurf:extension/pacy-devtools.pacy-devtools-bridge">Install Windsurf Extension</a>

For Cursor and Windsurf, you can download the following file and drag and drop it to your editor's extensions tab:
- <a href="https://github.com/pacy-dev/pacy-devtools/raw/refs/heads/main/packages/vscode/pacy-devtools-bridge-0.1.1.vsix">Pacy Devtools Bridge</a>

#### Manual Installation

If these links don't work, or you'd like to use pacy with another VSCode-based editor, you can search "Pacy Devtools Bridge" in your editor, or you can download the `.vsix` file from the following link, and later drag and drop it into your editor's extensions tab:

- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pacy-devtools.pacy-devtools-bridge">Pacy Devtools Bridge in VSCode Marketplace</a>

<Aside title='Hint'>

A VS Code extension's offline install package (VSIX) is available at:

```
https://${publisher}.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/${publisher}/extension/${extension name}/${version}/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage
```
</Aside>

### MCP Installation Issues

#### Manual Installation

For manually installing the MCP server, you can add this to your AI agent's MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pacy-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@pacy-dev/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

{/* Here are some configuration file locations:

- Cline: `${BASEDIR}/${EDITOR}/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`,
- RooCode: `${BASEDIR}/${EDITOR}/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`,
- Windsurf: `${HOMEDIR}/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`,
- Cursor: `${HOMEDIR}/.cursor/mcp.json`,
- VSCode: `${BASEDIR}/Code/User/settings.json`

`${EDITOR}` is the name of the editor you're using. Remember that it's `Code` for VSCode, `Cursor` for Cursor, and `Windsurf` for Windsurf.

You can fill the `${BASEDIR}`, `${HOMEDIR}` based on your OS. */}

{/* ## Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to the Pacy CLI, you can try the following solutions:

1. Validate if the Pacy CLI is running by running `pacy status` in the terminal.

2. If it's not running, start it by running `pacy start`. The problem might be resolved.

3. Make sure that the port number from the `pacy status` command is the same as the one in the browser extension settings.

4. If none of the above works, you can use a different port by running `pacy set-port <port>` in the terminal. 
Don't forget to update the port in the browser extension settings as well. The problem might be resolved. */}

## Code Inspector Issues

### Code inspector is showing the right file path, but the line number is wrong

1. Use `@pacy-dev/devtools-plugin` to configure your project.
2. If you're using React with Vite, and if the `@vitejs/plugin-react` or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` is listed among the plugins, make sure `@pacy-dev/devtools-plugin` comes before.
3. Similarly, if you're using Vue, Svelte or any other framework, make sure `@pacy-dev/devtools-plugin` comes before the framework's plugin.

## How It Works

### Development Server Proxying

Pacy Devtools automatically:

1. **Detects** your development server ports (common frameworks supported)
2. **Proxies** traffic through an available port 
3. **Injects** debugging tools and WebSocket connections
4. **Preserves** all original functionality while adding development features

### Port Detection

The CLI intelligently detects development servers by:
- Parsing package.json scripts for port configurations
- Watching for new services that start up
- Avoiding conflicts with existing services
